# Skill: ac-quality

Three checks per AC:

1. **Observable** — a user, test, or operator can tell whether it is satisfied without reading the diff.
2. **Independently committable** — a single commit covering only this AC is meaningful.
3. **Verifiable** — there is an explicit verification line (test name, manual step, or command).

## Smell check

| smell | example | rewrite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sub-task | "implement the helper" | "search returns BM25-ranked results for queries with multiple terms" |
| vague verification | "tests pass" | "verified by tests/unit/search.test.ts: 'returns BM25-ranked hits'" |
| internal detail | "refactor the cache" | "cache hit rate >90% on the dashboard repaint scenario" |
| compound AC | "build the page and add analytics" | split into two AC |

## Numbering

- AC ids start at `AC-1` and are sequential.
- Refinement slugs restart at `AC-1` even when they refine a slug that had AC-1..AC-12.
- Do not reuse an AC id within the same slug; if you delete an AC, the remaining ids stay sequential after compaction.

## When to add an AC mid-flight

You don't. Adding AC during build is scope creep. Either the new work fits an existing AC (no new id), or it should be a follow-up (`/cc-idea`) or a fresh slug.
