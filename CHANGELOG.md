# Changelog

## 0.52.0

### Breaking Changes

- Dropped legacy knowledge-entry compatibility aliases for the pre-cleanup idea source and old origin field. All knowledge rows must use canonical `source: "idea"` and `origin_run`.
- Removed installer cleanup/migration handling for pre-cleanup command/skill aliases from the retired next/idea-era shim set. Projects still carrying those legacy surfaces must run a manual `npx cclaw-cli uninstall && npx cclaw-cli init`.

## 0.51.28

### Fixed

- Made the artifact linter tolerate the actual shipped template shape: structural-field regexes for `Mode Block Token`, `Anti-Sycophancy Acknowledgement`, and `Regression Iron Rule Acknowledgement` now accept optional markdown emphasis (`*`, `**`, `_`) around both the field name and the value. Previously `- **Mode:** STARTUP` (the form the template ships and the agent fills in) failed validation because the regex only allowed plain whitespace between `Mode:` and the token.
- Extended `Approach Tier Classification` to recognize `lite` (alias for `Lightweight`) in addition to `Lightweight`, `Standard`, and `Deep`, so artifacts written verbatim from the `lite | standard | deep` template default are accepted. State-contract `approachTier` taxonomy now lists both spellings for downstream consumers.
- Added explicit placeholder detection for both `Mode Block` and `Approach Tier`: a line that lists ≥2 distinct tokens (the unfilled template placeholder, e.g. `Tier: lite | standard | deep`) now fails with a targeted message instead of silently passing on incidental token presence.

### Added

- Regression fixtures in `tests/unit/quality-gate-fixtures.test.ts` for the actual shipped template shape: bold-form `Mode Block` / `Anti-Sycophancy Stamp` / `Regression Iron Rule` pass; bold-form Mode placeholder fails; `Tier: lite` passes; `Tier: lite | standard | deep` placeholder fails. Earlier fixtures used the unbolded form (`- Mode: ENGINEERING`) which never exercised the runtime template.

## 0.51.27

### Fixed

- Hardened the delegation proof model with ledger schema v3 and a `legacy-inferred` fulfillment mode, so pre-v3 ledger rows are surfaced as `legacyRequiresRerecord` and explicitly upgraded via the `delegation-record.mjs --rerecord` helper instead of silently passing stage-complete.
- Locked the `delegation-record.mjs` helper down: `--dispatch-surface` now strictly validates against the `DELEGATION_DISPATCH_SURFACES` enum (rejecting legacy `task`), `--agent-definition-path` is verified against the harness-specific directory layout, and `--ack-ts` is mandatory for `event=completed` with isolated/generic surfaces.
- Split `stage-complete` diagnostics into granular categories (`missing`, `missingDispatchProof`, `legacyInferredCompletions`, `corruptEventLines`, `staleWorkers`, `waivedWithEvidence`) with per-failure `nextActions`, eliminating opaque "missing delegations" failures.
- Generated per-harness lifecycle recipes (OpenCode / Codex / Cursor / Claude) with the correct dispatch surface, neutral placeholders, and dispatch-surface table dynamically rendered from the runtime enum, keeping `docs/harnesses.md` in sync with `src/delegation.ts`.

### Changed

- Upgraded all eight stage templates (brainstorm → ship) and skills with universal, domain-neutral quality gates: mode selection blocks, premise-challenge / forcing questions, mandatory alternatives with calibrated confidence (1–10), STOP-per-issue protocol, anti-sycophancy framing, NO-PLACEHOLDERS rule, watched-RED proof for TDD, ASCII coverage diagrams for design, vertical-slice TDD with per-cycle refactor, and a 4-option ship gate. No domain-specific terminology (web, CRUD, dashboard, framework names) leaks into agent instructions, templates, or linter rules.
- Promoted reusable cross-cutting building blocks (`stopPerIssueBlock`, `confidenceCalibrationBlock`, `outsideVoiceSlotBlock`, `antiSycophancyBlock`, `noPlaceholdersBlock`, `watchedFailProofBlock`) in `src/content/skills.ts` so each stage skill composes the same mechanics consistently.
- Expanded the artifact linter with structural-only checks for every stage (presence of mode block, alternatives table columns, confidence-finding format, watched-RED evidence, etc.), keeping checks domain-neutral and agnostic to task type.

### Added

- `docs/quality-gates.md` mapping every cclaw section to its source pattern in `gstack`, `superpowers`, and `evanflow`, with diverse non-web examples (CLI utility, library, infra/migration).
- `tests/unit/quality-gate-fixtures.test.ts` with regression coverage for the helper (rejects `task`, validates path, requires `ack-ts`), the linter on diverse non-web task types across all 8 stages, and an end-to-end `--rerecord` flow that upgrades a legacy-inferred row to v3 and clears `legacyRequiresRerecord`.

## 0.51.25

### Fixed

- Added reference-grade subagent execution contracts with expanded specialist routing, worker lifecycle evidence, stricter delegation waivers, vertical-slice TDD guidance, managed recovery paths, and no-VCS verification support.
- Made the README a lighter operating front door with ASCII flow, recovery guidance, and subagent evidence framing, backed by a tracked `docs/scheme-of-work.md` flow contract.
- Added docs/generated contract regressions and refreshed generated guidance so status, recovery, track routing, and reference-pattern expectations stay aligned with runtime behavior.

## 0.51.24

### Fixed

- Upgraded brainstorm, scope, and design into an adaptive reference-grade flow with product/technical discovery, strategic scope contracts, and engineering-lock evidence.
- Strengthened staged specialist agents and review evidence so generated harness guidance requires anchored findings, changed-file coverage, security attestations, and dependency/version checks where relevant.
- Hardened runtime correctness around pre-push range detection, Codex hook readiness/wiring diagnostics, compound-before-archive checks, and knowledge/seed retrieval quality.

## 0.51.23

### Fixed

- Materialized generated stage command shims so stage skills no longer point agents at missing `.cclaw/commands/<stage>.md` files.
- Restored native subagent dispatch surfaces for OpenCode and Codex via generated `.opencode/agents/*.md` and `.codex/agents/*.toml` agent definitions, with role-switch retained only as a degraded fallback.
- Tightened harness delegation, hook/sync diagnostics, quick-track templates, and knowledge metadata regressions so installed runtime guidance matches validation behavior.

## 0.51.22

### Fixed

- Repaired audit-found flow contract gaps across runtime gates, generated templates, hooks, knowledge retrieval, delegation validation, and installer diagnostics.
- Added regressions for quick-track artifact scaffolds, retro/archive evidence validation, TDD refactor ordering, hook lifecycle coverage, init recovery, and canonical knowledge/delegation semantics.

## 0.51.19

### Fixed

- Materialized every subagent dispatch `skill` reference as a generated `.cclaw/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` context skill, so mandatory/proactive routing no longer points agents at missing or deprecated skill folders.
- Added regression coverage that every dispatch `skill` reference is generated, every referenced agent exists in the core roster, install writes those context skills, and every required artifact validator section appears in that stage's canonical template.

## 0.51.18

### Fixed

- Aligned the brainstorm SKILL guidance and `Self-Review Notes` validation rule with the calibrated review format (`Status: Approved` | `Issues Found`, `Patches applied:`, `Remaining concerns:`); removed the legacy "or - None." shortcut that contradicted the structural validator and caused first-attempt stage-complete failures.
- Added a Context Loading step that points every stage skill at its canonical artifact template (`.cclaw/templates/<NN>-<stage>.md`) so agents draft per-row Approaches tables and the calibrated review block from the start instead of inventing layouts that fail validation.

## 0.51.17

### Fixed

- Relaxed the brainstorm calibrated `Self-Review Notes` validator: it now accepts `Status:` lines with trailing context, treats both inline notes and sub-bullets as valid for `Patches applied:` / `Remaining concerns:`, and reports per-line problems instead of one opaque message. The unfilled placeholder `Status: Approved | Issues Found` is now explicitly rejected with an actionable hint to pick exactly one value.
- Updated the brainstorm artifact template default to `Status: Approved` so freshly drafted artifacts pass validation without manual placeholder cleanup, while review-prompt documentation continues to show both canonical values.

## 0.51.16

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenCode hook execution so generated plugins spawn a real Node executable instead of accidentally re-entering the OpenCode CLI through `process.execPath`.
- Added active stage contracts and calibrated review prompts to session bootstrap context, making stage structure and self-review expectations visible before artifact drafting.
- Improved brainstorm validation feedback for transposed `Approaches` tables and enforced calibrated `Self-Review Notes` format when that section is present.
- Made managed `start-flow` record seed, origin-document, and stack-marker discovery in `00-idea.md`.
- Added automatic delegation-log waivers for untriggered proactive dispatch rows so skipped helper reviews remain auditable.

## 0.51.15

### Fixed

- Added real test-command discovery for verification gates: `tdd_verified_before_complete` and `review_trace_matrix_clean` now check gate evidence against discovered project test commands when available.
- Updated review templates and stage skills to record verification command discovery explicitly.

## 0.51.14

### Fixed

- Added cross-stage reference checks so downstream design/spec/plan/review artifacts must reference every scope `R#` requirement and `LD#hash` locked-decision anchor.
- Updated scope/design/spec/plan templates to use `LD#hash` decision anchors instead of the legacy `D-XX` convention.
- Added structural validation for `LD#<sha8>` locked-decision anchors, including uniqueness and table hash consistency.

## 0.51.13

### Fixed

- Added generated per-stage state contracts under `.cclaw/templates/state-contracts/*.json` with `requiredTopLevelFields`, `taxonomies`, and `derivedMarkdownPath` so machine-readable stage shape is explicit.
- Added calibrated review prompt files for brainstorm self-review, scope CEO review, and design engineering review under `.cclaw/skills/review-prompts/`.
- Added a macOS Node 20 PR-gate job alongside Linux and Windows, and added install smoke coverage for state contracts and review prompts.

## 0.51.12

### Fixed

- Replaced brainstorm challenger detection with structural `Approaches` table validation: `Role` must be `baseline`, `challenger`, or `wild-card`; `Upside` must be `low`, `modest`, `high`, or `higher`; exactly one challenger must have `high` or `higher` upside.
- Added structural `Requirements` priority validation for scope artifacts (`P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, or `DROPPED`) instead of leaving priority as unchecked prose.
- Updated brainstorm regressions to use canonical `Role`/`Upside` columns, including non-Latin artifact prose with stable machine-readable taxonomy fields.

## 0.51.11

### Fixed

- Removed the generic validation-rule keyword matcher entirely, so artifact prose is no longer checked by copied English/backticked words from schema descriptions.
- Made `Premise Challenge` bullet validation depend only on substantive row content, not question marks or English Q/A phrasing.
- Replaced the Russian-specific Scope Summary regression with a non-Latin-script regression spanning multiple scripts, so the guard protects all natural languages rather than one test case.

## 0.51.10

### Fixed

- Replaced the brittle keyword-grep on `Scope Summary` with structural validation that requires a canonical scope mode token (`SCOPE EXPANSION` / `SELECTIVE EXPANSION` / `HOLD SCOPE` / `SCOPE REDUCTION`) and a track-aware next-stage handoff, so non-English scope artifacts no longer fail validation for missing English keywords.
- Made `Premise Challenge` validation purely structural (≥3 substantive Q/A rows in a table or bullet list); answers may be in any language and the linter no longer requires the literal English question phrasing.
- Tightened `extractRequiredKeywords` to fire only on backticked machine-surface tokens, so descriptive prose in validation rules stops being mis-treated as required keywords.

### Changed

- Strengthened the `brainstorm` execution model and template with reference-grade structure: `Premise Check`, `How Might We` reframing, `Sharpening Questions` (decision-impact column), `Not Doing` list, `Self-Review Notes`, and a stable `Approaches` table with canonical `Role` (`baseline` | `challenger` | `wild-card`) and `Upside` (`low` | `modest` | `high` | `higher`) columns.
- Strengthened the `scope` execution model with an explicit premise + leverage check and mode-specific analysis matched to the chosen gstack mode (SCOPE EXPANSION / SELECTIVE EXPANSION / HOLD SCOPE / SCOPE REDUCTION); template now exposes `Strongest challenges resolved` and `Recommended path` as explicit Scope Summary fields.

## 0.51.3

### Fixed

- Aligned brainstorm artifact templates and generated skill validation guidance with the hidden linter checks for `Approach Reaction`, `Selected Direction`, and `challenger: higher-upside` rows.
- Made brainstorm artifact validation failures include actionable rule/details text instead of only opaque check names such as `Direction Reaction Trace`.
- Reinforced brainstorm interaction guidance so structured question tools ask one decision-changing question at a time instead of bundled multi-question forms.

## 0.51.2

### Fixed

- Fixed `internal advance-stage` and generated `stage-complete.mjs` compatibility with real shell usage by accepting both `--evidence-json=<json>` and `--evidence-json <json>` forms.
- Coerced boolean/object/number gate evidence JSON values into stored evidence strings so copied completion commands do not silently drop non-string evidence.
- Strengthened generated stage completion guidance to stop on helper failures instead of manually editing `flow-state.json`, preserving validation and `## Learnings` harvest.

## 0.51.1

### Fixed

- Made generated `stage-complete.mjs` advance stages through the local Node runtime instead of requiring a runtime `cclaw` binary in `PATH`, preserving gate validation and `## Learnings` harvest.
- Clarified generated prompts and docs so `cclaw-cli` is the installer/support surface while `/cc*` commands and Node hooks are the normal in-session runtime.
- Added a generated Conversation Language Policy so user-facing prose follows the user's language while stable commands, ids, schemas, and artifact headings remain canonical.
- Aligned normal-flow knowledge guidance around artifact-first `## Learnings` capture and reserved direct JSONL writes for explicit manual learning operations.

## 0.51.0

### Fixed

- Made `npx cclaw-cli sync` discoverable in CLI help, always print fixes for
  failing checks, and point recovery docs at existing local files.
- Fixed non-flow headless envelopes for `/cc-idea` and `/cc-view` so they no
  longer masquerade as brainstorm/review stage outputs.
- Made `sync --only` JSON and exit-code semantics scoped to the filtered
  checks while preserving `globalOk` for the full suite.
- Replaced bash-based Node probing in sync with platform-native command
  checks, and made hook wrappers loudly report skipped hooks when `node` is
  missing.

### Changed

- Added digest-first knowledge wording to session/research guidance and
  standardized resume wording on `/cc`.
- Centralized post-ship closeout substate guidance and strengthened
  verification-before-completion wording.
- Added a flow-state schema version for future migrations.
- Improved onboarding with Node 20+, repo-root install guidance, local docs
  pointers, and a static generated `AGENTS.md` block example.

## 0.50.0

Full phase-1 cleanup. This release removes the remaining heavy surfaces
that made a fresh install feel like a framework dump instead of a harness
workflow tool.

### Removed

- Removed the feature/worktree system, including the `feature-system`
  runtime, generated worktree state, and the user-facing feature command
  surface.
- Removed `/cc-ops` and its legacy subcommands. Flow progression and
  closeout now stay on `/cc`; explicit archival/reset stays on
  `cclaw archive`.
- Shrank generated commands to the four real entrypoints: `/cc`,
  `/cc`, `/cc-idea`, and `/cc-view`.
- Stopped scaffolding derived/cache state files on init. Runtime hooks now
  create optional diagnostics only when needed.
- Removed broad default utility skills and kept the generated skill surface
  focused on flow stages, cclaw routing, subagent/parallel dispatch,
  session, learnings, research playbooks, and opt-in language rule packs.
- Removed the internal eval harness, its CLI command, fixtures, docs,
  tests, and the unused `openai` runtime dependency.
- Removed stale generated-reference templates and docs that pointed users
  at `.cclaw/references`, `.cclaw/contexts`, worktrees, or `/cc-ops`.
- Removed the unused internal `knowledge-digest` subcommand and stopped
  materializing `knowledge-digest.md`; session bootstrap reads
  `knowledge.jsonl` directly.
- Removed saved `flow-state.snapshot.json` semantics from `/cc-view diff`.
  The view command is now read-only and uses visible git evidence instead
  of creating derived state.
- Removed the stale `.cclaw/features/**` preview line and remaining
  "active feature" wording from generated guidance after the feature
  system removal.
- Removed feature-system fields from new archive manifests; archives now
  record `runName` instead of `featureName` / `activeFeature`.
- Removed the legacy `/cc-learn` command surface from generated guidance.
  Knowledge work remains available through the `learnings` skill, while
  the visible slash-command surface stays at `/cc`, `/cc`,
  `/cc-idea`, and `/cc-view`.
- Removed an unused TDD batch walkthrough export and the large stage-skill
  golden snapshot file; contract tests now assert behavioral anchors instead
  of pinning generated prose.
- Stopped scaffolding the unused `stage-activity.jsonl` ledger. Fresh installs
  now start with only `flow-state.json` and `iron-laws.json` under
  `.cclaw/state`.
- Removed stale eval GitHub Actions workflows and `.gitignore` exceptions that
  still referenced deleted `.cclaw/evals` fixtures.
- Removed stale ignore/config entries for the deleted `docs/references` and
  `scripts/reference-sync.sh` reference-research surface.
- Consolidated `/cc-view` generated guidance into one `flow-view` skill with
  embedded `status`, `tree`, and `diff` subcommand sections. Sync now removes
  the old `flow-status`, `flow-tree`, and `flow-diff` skill folders.
- Removed obsolete standalone `status`, `tree`, and `diff` command contract
  generators that were only kept alive by tests after `/cc-view` consolidation.
- Converted view subcommand generators into embedded bodies without standalone
  skill frontmatter, matching the single generated `flow-view` surface.
- Replaced generated artifact template frontmatter `feature: <feature-id>` with
  `run: <run-id>` while keeping legacy `feature` frontmatter accepted for
  existing artifacts during migration.

### Changed

- Renamed the generated stop hook from `stop-checkpoint` to `stop-handoff`
  to match the simplified session model. Old managed `stop-checkpoint`
  entries are still recognized during sync cleanup.
- Renamed the stop safety law id to `stop-clean-or-handoff`; existing
  configs using the old checkpoint id are still honored.
- Simplified session bootstrap and stop behavior around artifact handoff
  instead of separate checkpoint/context/suggestion state files.
- Centralized legacy cleanup lists in init/sync so removed surfaces are
  easier to audit without changing upgrade cleanup behavior.
- Renamed pre-compact semantic coverage from digest wording to compatibility
  wording and aligned harness/view docs with `npx cclaw-cli sync`.
- Compact stage skills now fold inputs and required context into the existing
  context-loading block, reducing repeated generated sections while preserving
  the process map, gates, evidence, and artifact validation.
- Downstream stage artifacts now include a lightweight `Upstream Handoff`
  section for carried decisions, constraints, open questions, and drift
  reasons, so agents do not silently rewrite earlier stage choices.
- Knowledge JSONL entries now use `origin_run` instead of feature wording for
  new writes and generated guidance, while older pre-cleanup rows remained
  readable as an input alias at the time of this release.
- Codex legacy skill cleanup now removes any old `cclaw-cc*` folder by prefix
  instead of carrying a hardcoded list of obsolete command names.
- The generated meta-skill, shared stage guidance, `/cc`, and harness shims
  now show the whole flow explicitly: critical-path stages finish with
  `retro -> compound -> archive` through `/cc`.
- TDD dispatch guidance now presents one mandatory `test-author` evidence cycle
  for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR instead of implying three default subagents.
- Stage guidance now starts with a compact drift preamble, treats seed recall as
  reference context by default, and makes brainstorm/scope use lightweight
  compact paths before deeper checklists.
- Design/spec/plan guidance now adopts prompt-level investigator/critic, shadow
  alternative, acceptance mapping, and exact verification-command discipline
  without adding new runtime machinery.
- Review guidance now defaults to one reviewer plus mandatory security-reviewer,
  with adversarial review as a risk-triggered pass instead of ceremony for every
  large-ish diff.
- Generated status/docs/idea guidance now avoids stale waiver and legacy-layout
  wording in the primary user surface.
- Prompt-surface tests now prefer durable behavioral anchors over exact generated
  prose where schema and validator tests already cover the contract.
- Decision Protocol / structured-ask fallback wording is now shared across
  scope/design/review/ship/idea to reduce drift between stage prompts.
- Scope/design outside-voice loop guidance now renders from compact policy helpers
  in `review-loop.ts` instead of repeated prose blocks.
- Post-ship closeout wording is now sourced from shared closeout guidance
  helpers so /cc and meta-skill stay aligned on retro/compound/archive.
- /cc-idea knowledge scan guidance now matches the live knowledge schema
  (`rule|pattern|lesson|compound`, `origin_run`, trigger/action clustering).
- Track-aware render context now drives quick-track wording transforms for TDD/lint metadata, replacing duplicated brittle string-rewrite chains.
- Hook runtime compound-readiness summary now uses a shared inline formatter helper, with added parity coverage to reduce drift against canonical CLI wording.

### Preserved

- `retro -> compound -> archive` remains part of ship closeout through
  `/cc`.
- `cclaw archive` still archives active runs into `.cclaw/archive/`.
- Stage skills still keep decision, completion, verification, and
  closeout discipline, but now inline the needed guidance instead of
  making users chase generated reference files.

## 0.49.0

Dead-weight cut, pass 1. `.cclaw/` was shipping four scaffolded
directories whose content no runtime code ever consumed, no user ever
edited, and no test depended on beyond "file exists". Each added noise
to `ls .cclaw`, `npx cclaw-cli sync`, and `cclaw sync` without moving any
flow decision. This release removes them.

### Removed

- `.cclaw/adapters/manifest.json` — the "harness adapter provenance"
  file was never read outside of the three sync gates that verified
  its own existence. Dropped the file, its three
  `state:adapter_manifest_*` gates, and the init preview line.
- `.cclaw/custom-skills/` — opt-in scaffold for user-authored skills
  with a ~150-line README and a placeholder `example/SKILL.md`. In
  practice users either never opened the folder or put skills under
  `.cclaw/skills/` anyway. No routing layer ever discovered
  `custom-skills/*.md`. Dropped the dir, the install helper, the
  two template strings, and the using-cclaw meta-skill paragraph
  advertising it.
- `.cclaw/worktrees/` **empty scaffold** — the git-worktree feature
  itself (feature-system, using-git-worktrees skill, state/worktrees.json)
  stays in place for now, but init no longer pre-creates an empty
  top-level folder. Full feature removal is out of scope for this
  release.
- `.cclaw/contexts/*.md` — the four static mode guides
  (`default.md`, `execution.md`, `review.md`, `incident.md`) are gone.
  Context mode switching is still a first-class feature (tracked via
  `state/context-mode.json`, surfaced by session hooks, described in
  the `context-engineering` skill), but the mode bodies now live
  inline in the skill rather than as separate files. Session hooks
  already gracefully degrade when `contexts/<mode>.md` is missing
  (`existsSync` check), so users see no behavioral change beyond
  four fewer files per install and four fewer `contexts:mode:*`
  gates in `sync`.

### Why

Each of these folders was individually defensible but collectively
turned a fresh `cclaw init` into a 167-file dump across 15
top-level directories. Comparing against the reference implementations
under `~/Projects/cclaw/docs/references/` (obra-superpowers ships
14 skills / 3 commands; addyosmani-skills ships 21 skills flat;
everyinc-compound ships ~25 files total), cclaw was an order of
magnitude heavier without being an order of magnitude more useful.
This pass removes ~305 LOC of installer code and four user-visible
folders without changing any runtime behavior. Subsequent releases
will apply the same lens to `.cclaw/references/`, `.cclaw/evals/`,
`.cclaw/commands/`, `.cclaw/state/`, and `.cclaw/skills/`.

## 0.48.35

Second pass on the OpenCode plugin guard-UX fix. 0.48.34 covered the
obvious cases (read-only bypass, graceful degradation, killswitch,
actionable error), but a real-world `/cc` session still hit three
remaining failure modes:

1. `strictness: advisory` in `.cclaw/config.yaml` was ignored by the
   plugin — guard non-zero exits still threw.
2. OpenCode's `question` / `AskUserQuestion` tool (and friends) were
   not on the safe-tool whitelist, so track-selection prompts were
   blocked mid-flow.
3. Hook-runtime infrastructure failures (unrelated CLI help in
   stderr, crashes, missing binaries) were surfaced to the user as
   policy blocks with the yargs help text showing up as the "Reason".

### Fixed

- Plugin now reads the same strictness knob as the hook runtime
  (`CCLAW_STRICTNESS` env → `strictness:` key in
  `.cclaw/config.yaml` → library default `advisory`). In advisory
  mode — which is the default — guard refusals are logged as
  `advisory:` lines in `.cclaw/logs/opencode-plugin.log` and the tool
  call proceeds. Only `strictness: strict` ever throws.
- Safe-tool whitelist now exempts question / ask / `AskUserQuestion`
  / `ask_user_question` / `request_user_input` / prompt, think /
  thinking, todo / `TodoRead` / `TodoWrite` (with `find` added
  alongside ls/list). These tools cannot mutate project state or
  execute arbitrary code, so running guards on them was overhead at
  best and a blocker at worst.
- Hook infrastructure failures are no longer treated as policy
  blocks. A non-zero hook exit whose stderr looks like yargs help
  (`Usage:` / `Options:` / `-- name  [string]` lines), a Node crash
  fingerprint (`Cannot find module`, `(Reference|Syntax|Type|Range)Error`,
  `at file:line:col`, `node:internal`), a "command not found" shell
  message, or empty output now logs an `infra:` line and lets the
  tool through regardless of strictness. Strict mode still blocks on
  cleanly-structured guard refusals.
- Strict-mode block error now also points at switching to
  `strictness: advisory` in `.cclaw/config.yaml` as a recovery path
  alongside `CCLAW_DISABLE=1`.

### Changed

- `tests/unit/hooks-lifecycle.test.ts` grows three coverage cases
  (advisory-default log-only path, extended whitelist bypass across 9
  tool-name variants, infra-noise bypass under strict config) and
  the existing strict-block test now emits a short refusal reason so
  it still exercises the thrown path after the infra-noise
  heuristic tightened.

## 0.48.34

OpenCode guard UX fix. A user hitting a freshly-installed cclaw project
in OpenCode previously saw every tool call — including innocuous
`read`/`glob`/`grep` — blocked by the cryptic error
`cclaw OpenCode guard blocked tool.execute.before (prompt/workflow
guard non-zero exit).`, with `console.error` stderr spam overlapping
the TUI render. The failure mode was the same whether the guards had
legitimately refused a mutation, the hook runtime was missing, the
script crashed, or cclaw wasn't initialized in the project at all.
This release reshapes the plugin so users can actually use OpenCode.

### Fixed

- Read-only tools (`read`, `glob`, `grep`, `list`, `view`, `webfetch`,
  `websearch`) now bypass the prompt/workflow guard chain — they
  cannot mutate state or execute arbitrary code, so the guard spawn
  was pure overhead and a single point of failure for the whole
  session.
- Projects without `.cclaw/state/flow-state.json` or
  `.cclaw/hooks/run-hook.mjs` are treated as "cclaw not initialized"
  and no longer block tool calls; a one-shot advisory is recorded in
  the plugin log instead of throwing.
- Hot-path `console.error` calls in `runHookScript` and the event
  dispatcher are replaced with file-based logging to
  `.cclaw/logs/opencode-plugin.log` — eliminates the overlapping-text
  TUI artifact that made failing sessions unreadable.
- Guard block errors now name the failing guard, include the last
  ~400 bytes of its stderr as `Reason`, and suggest
  `npx cclaw-cli sync` + `CCLAW_DISABLE=1` recovery moves, replacing the
  uniform unactionable block message.

### Added

- `CCLAW_DISABLE=1` env killswitch (also honoured via `CCLAW_GUARDS=off`
  and `CCLAW_STRICTNESS=off|disabled|none`) lets users bypass the
  plugin's guards when they are stuck, without editing the generated
  plugin file. The bypass is logged once to the plugin log.
- `.cclaw/logs/opencode-plugin.log` — timestamped append-only
  diagnostic log for plugin-side hook failures, timeouts, unknown
  events, and the advisory states above. Best-effort; never blocks a
  hook on I/O failure.

### Changed

- Prompt-guard and workflow-guard now run in parallel via
  `Promise.all` on each mutating `tool.execute.before`, halving the
  steady-state guard latency (bounded already by
  `MAX_CONCURRENT_HOOKS = 2`, so no queue change needed).
- Per-hook timeout reduced from 20 s to 5 s. Typical guard runtime is
  well under 500 ms, so 5 s keeps real hooks working while capping the
  worst-case stall at a number a user will still tolerate.
- `tests/unit/hooks-lifecycle.test.ts` gains four coverage cases
  (read-only bypass, uninitialized project, `CCLAW_DISABLE`
  killswitch, actionable error shape) alongside the existing
  non-zero-exit block test.

## 0.48.33

Stage-flow consolidation, cross-platform notes, and inline-hook locality
release. Addresses three flow-quality issues flagged in the user-flow
audit: overlapping parallel instruction lists inside stage skills,
accidental platform-agnostic-by-default stage guidance, and inline JS
bodies buried in the 2000-line `node-hooks.ts` template.

### Changed

- Stage SKILL.md `## Process` now renders a **mermaid flowchart TD**
  derived from `executionModel.process` (or from
  `executionModel.processFlow` when a stage defines a custom
  non-linear graph), replacing the previous dedupe'd top-5 flat list.
  `## Interaction Protocol` keeps its dedupe'd top-5 list but opens with
  an explicit preamble stating the section is *behavioral rules*, not an
  alternative sequence of steps.
- Added optional `StageExecutionModel.processFlow` (custom mermaid body)
  and `StageExecutionModel.platformNotes` (rendered under a new
  `## Platform Notes` section). Bumped the stage-skill line budget from
  350 to 400 to accommodate the mermaid state-machine diagram and
  platform-notes block.
- Filled `platformNotes` for all eight stages with concrete cross-OS
  guidance — path separators, shell quoting, CRLF/LF drift, PowerShell
  vs POSIX env-var syntax, UTC timestamps, and release-flow signing
  differences — so agent-generated instructions stay portable.
- Extracted the inline JS bodies (`computeCompoundReadinessInline`,
  `computeRalphLoopStatusInline`, and shared helpers) out of
  `src/content/node-hooks.ts` into a dedicated
  `src/content/hook-inline-snippets.ts` module. Each snippet carries an
  explicit "mirrors X, parity enforced by Y" header.
  `tests/unit/ralph-loop-parity.test.ts` keeps the parity contract
  intact; `run-hook.mjs` output is byte-identical.

### Fixed

- `spec` checklist now includes the "present acceptance criteria in
  3-5-item batches, pause for ACK" step that previously only lived in
  the `process` duplicate list and would have silently dropped out of
  the rendered skill after the mermaid rewrite.

## 0.48.32

Stage-audit implementation release (Phase 6 completion). This cut finalizes the
remaining opt-in upgrades with config-driven toggles, a reusable seed shelf, and
an optional second-opinion path for review loops.

### Changed

- Replaced env-based scope/design audit toggles with config-driven switches under
  `.cclaw/config.yaml::optInAudits` (`scopePreAudit`, `staleDiagramAudit`) and
  updated lint/runtime tests accordingly.
- Added seed shelf support via `src/content/seed-shelf.ts` with collision-safe
  `SEED-YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` naming, `trigger_when` matching, and seed-template
  rendering for deferred high-upside ideas.
- Extended `/cc` startup protocol with a dedicated seed-recall step so matching
  seeds are surfaced before routing when prompt triggers align.
- Added “plant as seed” guidance + template sections across idea, brainstorm,
  scope, and design artifacts to preserve promising non-selected directions.
- Extended review-loop internals with `createSecondOpinionDispatcher` and merged
  second-opinion scoring/findings behind
  `.cclaw/config.yaml::reviewLoop.externalSecondOpinion.*`.
- Added config schema/docs/tests for `reviewLoop.externalSecondOpinion` (`enabled`,
  `model`, `scoreDeltaThreshold`) and disagreement surfacing when score deltas
  exceed the configured threshold.

## 0.48.31

Phase-0 renderer migration to grouped v2 stage views. This cut switches stage
skill generation to a group-first layout and trims repetitive sections to keep
skill bodies concise.

### Changed

- Updated `stageSkillMarkdown` rendering to consume grouped metadata directly in
  fixed order: `philosophy` -> `executionModel` -> `artifactRules` ->
  `reviewLens`.
- Added explicit `## Complexity Tier` output in stage skills so active tier and
  tier-scoped mandatory delegations are visible at runtime.
- Moved `HARD-GATE` and anti-pattern rendering into the Philosophy block and
  moved outputs/review sections under Review Lens to match v2 schema semantics.
- Removed always-inline Good/Bad and Domain example blocks from stage skills
  while retaining the concise examples pointer section, reducing generated skill
  line counts across all stages while preserving stage instructions.
- Updated flow contract snapshots to match the new stage skill layout.

## 0.48.30

Phase-0 v2 schema migration completion for downstream stages. This cut ports the
remaining legacy stage literals (`spec`, `plan`, `tdd`, `review`, `ship`) to
the grouped `schemaShape: "v2"` format without changing runtime contracts.

### Changed

- Migrated `spec`, `plan`, `tdd`, `review`, and `ship` stage definitions to v2
  grouped sections (`philosophy`, `executionModel`, `artifactRules`,
  `reviewLens`) and added explicit `complexityTier: "standard"` defaults.
- Kept stage behavior/contracts stable by preserving existing content and gate
  metadata while moving fields into grouped sections only.
- Updated TDD quick-track variant generation to transform nested v2 fields
  (checklists, required gates/evidence, traceability, and review sections)
  instead of legacy top-level keys.

## 0.48.29

Phase-0 artifact slug rollout for brainstorm/scope/design. This cut introduces
runtime-aware artifact path resolution with legacy fallback and updates stage
contracts to use slugged artifact patterns.

### Changed

- Added `resolveArtifactPath(stage, context)` in `src/artifact-paths.ts` with:
  topic slugification, collision-safe write naming (`-2`, `-3`, ...), and
  read-time fallback to legacy file names during migration.
- Updated runtime artifact readers (`artifact-linter`, `gate-evidence`,
  `internal/advance-stage`) to resolve stage artifacts via the shared helper
  instead of fixed file names.
- Switched audited stage artifact targets to slug patterns:
  `01-brainstorm-<slug>.md`, `02-scope-<slug>.md`, `03-design-<slug>.md`, and
  propagated the new upstream references to downstream stage traces.
- Replaced strict path-to-stage mapping in `stage-schema` with numeric-prefix
  inference so cross-stage filtering keeps working with slugged file names.
- Added resolver coverage tests (slugification, legacy fallback, collision
  handling) plus integration coverage proving plan lint reads the active
  slugged scope artifact when legacy + new files coexist.

## 0.48.28

Phase-0 schema consolidation follow-up. This cut migrates stage policy anchors
to a lint-metadata sidecar and starts v2 literal adoption in audited stages.

### Changed

- Moved `policyNeedles` out of stage literals and runtime schema fields into a
  dedicated sidecar module at `src/content/stages/_lint-metadata/index.ts`.
- Updated stage command-contract rendering to source anchors from
  `stagePolicyNeedles(...)` backed by lint metadata, preserving command output
  while decoupling policy anchors from runtime stage objects.
- Migrated `brainstorm`, `scope`, and `design` stage literals to
  `schemaShape: "v2"` grouped inputs (`philosophy`, `executionModel`,
  `artifactRules`, `reviewLens`) with normalization in `stageSchema(...)`.
- Updated schema types and tests to support mixed legacy/v2 stage inputs and
  verify policy-needle track transforms through the new metadata source.

## 0.48.27

Phase-0 schema consolidation slice. This release introduces a v2 stage-schema
surface with grouped metadata views and tier-aware mandatory delegation policy.

### Changed

- Added `schemaShape: "v2"` metadata to stage schemas, plus grouped views for
  philosophy, execution model, artifact rules, and review lens fields while
  retaining backward-compatible top-level properties.
- Added first-class `complexityTier` support on `StageSchema` with explicit
  defaults for audited stages (`brainstorm`, `scope`, `design`) and a standard
  fallback for stages that have not opted in yet.
- Added `requiredAtTier` to mandatory auto-subagent policies and updated
  delegation resolution so mandatory requirements can be gated by complexity
  tier without weakening current standard/deep paths.
- Expanded `stage-schema` tests to verify v2 parity, complexity-tier fallback,
  and tier-gated mandatory delegation behavior.

## 0.48.26

Stage-audit implementation release. This cut upgrades the upstream shaping
surface (`/cc-idea`, brainstorm, scope, design) with stronger divergence,
adversarial review loops, and richer design-review coverage.

### Changed

- `/cc-idea` now runs explicit mode classification, frame-based divergent
  ideation, adversarial critique, and survivor-only ranking before handoff.
- Brainstorm stage now supports depth tiering, a concrete-requirements
  short-circuit, and a strict propose -> react -> recommend flow with a
  mandatory higher-upside challenger option.
- Scope stage now includes a pre-scope system audit, optional landscape/taste
  calibration, and a bounded outside-voice review loop with quality-score
  tracking.
- Design stage now emphasizes Security/Threat, Observability, and
  Deployment/Rollout lenses; adds Standard+ shadow/error-flow diagram
  expectations; and tightens failure-mode guidance around rescue visibility.
- Design artifact template (`03-design.md`) now matches the upgraded design
  process with sections for shadow/error flow, threat modeling, observability,
  and rollout planning.

## 0.48.24

Roll-up of the lock-aware knowledge read + diagnostics (PR #131)
and the `reference:*` sync severity demotion (PR #132). Both
landed on `main` under `0.48.23` but needed a version bump to
reach npm.


### Changed

- Sync/runtime severity for `reference:*` checks (currently the
  `flow-map.md` section anchors, including
  `reference:flow_map:compound_readiness`) is demoted from
  `error` to `warning`. These docs document the surface rather
  than gate it; a missing section means the generated overview
  is out of date, not that a runtime contract is broken. The
  remediation hint still points at `cclaw sync`, so CI surfaces
  drift without hard-failing.

### Fixed

- SessionStart now reads `knowledge.jsonl` while holding the
  **same** mutex CLI writers use in `appendKnowledge`
  (`.cclaw/state/.knowledge.lock`). Closes a latent race where a
  concurrent `/cc-ops knowledge` append could produce a partial
  snapshot visible to the digest / compound-readiness computations.
- SessionStart's ralph-loop and compound-readiness error handlers
  no longer silently swallow exceptions — failures are now recorded
  as breadcrumbs in `.cclaw/state/hook-errors.jsonl` (still
  soft-fail so hooks never block on a malformed derived state, but
  `npx cclaw-cli sync` can now surface chronic failures).
- Directory locks (`withDirectoryLock` / the hook-inline variant)
  now fail fast with a clear "Lock path exists but is not a
  directory" error when the configured lock path is occupied by
  a non-directory instead of burning the entire retry budget.
  This stabilizes the session-start breadcrumb test on Windows,
  where `fs.mkdir(path)` against a file returns `EEXIST` (same
  as a held lock) and the old code could loop for seconds before
  giving up.

- Compound-readiness is now computed consistently across CLI and
  runtime. Previously `cclaw internal compound-readiness` honored
  `config.compound.recurrenceThreshold` while the SessionStart hook
  hard-coded `threshold = 3`, so the two paths could report different
  `readyCount` values on the same knowledge file. The hook now
  inherits the configured threshold at install time
  (`nodeHookRuntimeScript({ compoundRecurrenceThreshold })`), and both
  paths also apply the documented **small-project relaxation**
  (`<5` archived runs → effective threshold = `min(base, 2)`) that
  had previously existed only in the `/cc-ops compound` skill
  instructions. The derived status now includes `baseThreshold`,
  `archivedRunsCount`, and `smallProjectRelaxationApplied` so
  consumers can tell which rule fired. Schema bumped to `2`.
- `cclaw internal compound-readiness --threshold` now rejects
  non-integer values (`2abc`, `2.9`, `""`, negative) with a loud
  error instead of silently truncating via `parseInt`.
- `runCompoundReadinessCommand` now surfaces a stderr warning when
  `readConfig` fails instead of swallowing the error. The command
  also reads knowledge lock-aware by default so an in-flight
  `appendKnowledge` cannot produce a partial snapshot.
- SessionStart reads `knowledge.jsonl` exactly once per invocation
  and shares the raw content between the digest and the
  compound-readiness recomputation, eliminating the redundant
  second read on large knowledge logs.
- `lastUpdatedAt` in `compound-readiness.json` is now normalized
  identically in canonical and inline paths (milliseconds stripped),
  removing spurious diff noise.
- Parity tests (`tests/unit/ralph-loop-parity.test.ts`) extended to
  cover the new schema fields and the small-project relaxation.
- Atomic write on Windows: `fs.rename` sometimes fails transiently with
  `EPERM`/`EBUSY`/`EACCES` when the target file is briefly held open by
  antivirus, indexer, or a sibling hook process. Both the CLI-side
  `writeFileSafe` (`src/fs-utils.ts`) and the inline hook
  `writeFileAtomic` (`src/content/node-hooks.ts`) now retry up to 6
  times with ~10–70ms backoff before falling back to a non-atomic
  copy+unlink (still safe because callers hold a directory lock).
  Closes the Windows CI regression surfaced by
  `tests/unit/hook-atomic-writes.test.ts`.
- `parseTddCycleLog` now accepts an `issues` sink and a `strict` flag.
  In strict mode (used by `cclaw internal tdd-red-evidence` and
  validation paths), rows missing `runId`, `stage`, or `slice` are
  rejected instead of silently back-filling `runId=active,
  stage=tdd, slice=S-unknown`, which used to glue unrelated lines
  into the current run. Soft mode keeps the legacy defaults but
  can now surface per-line reasons (JSON parse failure, invalid
  phase, missing fields) via the issues array.
- `cclaw internal tdd-red-evidence` now requires a scoped `runId`.
  If neither `--runId` nor `flowState.activeRunId` is available,
  the command fails loud with a clear error instead of silently
  matching across all historical runs. Closes a false-positive
  path where a past failing RED for the same file could satisfy
  the guard on the current run.
- Unified TDD path-matcher across the CLI (`tdd-red-evidence`),
  the library (`src/tdd-cycle.ts`), and the runtime hook
  (`node-hooks.ts`). A new `normalizeTddPath` + `pathMatchesTarget`
  pair lives in `tdd-cycle.ts`; the inline hook mirrors the same
  rules and now matches `endsWith('/'+target)` instead of strict
  equality. Fixes a blind spot where the hook silently failed to
  find matching RED evidence when the recorded file path carried
  a repo-root prefix.
- Slice-aware workflow guard: when a TDD production write has no
  explicit path info, the fallback now consults the canonical
  Ralph Loop status (`computeRalphLoopStatusInline`) and blocks
  unless at least one slice has an OPEN RED. Previously a flat
  red/green tally could unlock writes for a new slice just because
  an older slice had balanced out.
- Single Ralph Loop contract inside `/cc progression contract surfaces`. The
  command contract and the skill document previously carried two
  different paragraphs — one called Ralph Loop a "soft nudge, not a
  gate", the other said "Advance only when every planned slice is in
  `acClosed` and `redOpenSlices` is empty" (hard-gating language). Both
  sections now render the SAME canonical snippet
  (`ralphLoopContractSnippet()` / `RALPH_LOOP_CONTRACT_MARKER`) stating
  the resolved policy: Ralph Loop is a progress indicator + soft
  pre-advance nudge; hard gate enforcement flows through
  `flow-state.json` gates via `stage-complete.mjs`. A new
  behavior-backed parity test in
  `next-command parity regression tests` asserts the
  canonical paragraph appears byte-identical in both places, that no
  hard-gating wording is used against ralph-loop fields, and that the
  legacy wording is gone.
- Runtime hooks (`run-hook.mjs`) now write JSON state atomically (temp
  file + rename, with EXDEV fallback) and serialize concurrent writes
  to the same file via per-file directory locks. This closes a class
  of torn-write and interleaved-JSONL races that could leave
  `ralph-loop.json`, `compound-readiness.json`, `checkpoint.json`,
  and `stage-activity.jsonl` in partial states under parallel session
  events.
- `readFlowState()` in the hook runtime now records a breadcrumb to
  `.cclaw/state/hook-errors.jsonl` when `flow-state.json` exists but
  fails JSON.parse, instead of silently falling back to `{}`. Makes
  latent CLI↔hook drift surfaceable via `npx cclaw-cli sync`.
- `archiveRun()` now holds both the archive lock and the flow-state
  lock for the entire archive window. Internal `writeFlowState`
  calls pass `skipLock: true` so no nested-lock deadlock occurs. This
  eliminates lost-update races where a concurrent stage mutation
  between archive snapshot and reset would be silently clobbered.

### Added

- Hook manifest as single source of truth (`src/content/hook-manifest.ts`).
  The per-harness JSON documents (`.claude/hooks/hooks.json`,
  `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`) and the semantic coverage
  table in `hook-events.ts` are now derived from one declarative manifest.
  New diagnostic: `cclaw internal hook-manifest [--harness <id>] [--json]`.
- Parity tests (`tests/unit/ralph-loop-parity.test.ts`) that seed a
  fixed TDD-cycle log / knowledge file and assert the inline
  implementations in the generated `run-hook.mjs` produce the same
  `ralph-loop.json` / `compound-readiness.json` as the canonical
  `computeRalphLoopStatus` and `computeCompoundReadiness` in core.
- Path-aware TDD guard routing via `tdd.testPathPatterns` and
  `tdd.productionPathPatterns`, including strict-mode blocking with the
  explicit message "Write a failing test first" when production edits happen
  before RED.
- Compound recurrence tuning via `compound.recurrenceThreshold` with
  small-project threshold relaxation (`<5` archived runs) and a
  `severity: critical` single-hit promotion override.
- Design-stage example snippet for the parallel research fleet workflow in
  `src/content/examples.ts`.

### Changed

- Compound command/skill contracts now document qualification source
  (`recurrence` vs `critical_override`) for every promoted cluster.
