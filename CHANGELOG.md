# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- Path-aware TDD guard routing via `tdd.testPathPatterns` and
  `tdd.productionPathPatterns`, including strict-mode blocking with the
  explicit message "Write a failing test first" when production edits happen
  before RED.
- Compound recurrence tuning via `compound.recurrenceThreshold` with
  small-project threshold relaxation (`<5` archived runs) and a
  `severity: critical` single-hit promotion override.
- Design-stage example snippet for the parallel research fleet workflow in
  `src/content/examples.ts`.

### Changed

- Compound command/skill contracts now document qualification source
  (`recurrence` vs `critical_override`) for every promoted cluster.
- Harness integration docs now include explicit parallel-research dispatch
  semantics per harness family (native parallel dispatch vs role-switch).
- README + config reference updated for research artifact flow and the new TDD
  and compound policy knobs.
